# babel-config
My personal babel/webpack config for es6+ code.

## Description
I use this as a boilerplate for developing libraries in es6+ javascript. There are no commands to generate this besides cloning the repository. I have added a few packages that I use consistently, but feel free to leave suggestions as needed. I left some basic examples of es6 and es7 code to prove that everything works.

## Features
* Ability to develop library code in es6/7/8 and transpile it to a lib directory
* Ability to test that code using es6/7/8 js
* Builds using webpack in a dev/prod webpack configuration
* To add types, create a `index.d.ts` file in the top level directory.
